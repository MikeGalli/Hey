@shawnr What’s your advice?
I’m trying to get my rows to have the same height. I’ve been trying to use “fixes" for Bootstrap’s col-lg-4. So far I haven’t been able to get anything to work. 
I used Bootstrap because I want the number of columns to be responsive. Would you recommend Flex Box, or Masonry, or….?
